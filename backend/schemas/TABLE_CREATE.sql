    -- OTHER TABLES LISTED AT BOTTOM OF THIS FILE FOR FUTURE UPDATES/EXPANSIONS
    -- ANY FOR THESE?
        -- OTHER TABLES FOR USER REGISTRATION, LOGIN, ETC. IN BACKEND/schemas/USER_AUTH_CREATE.sql
            -- Registration phase - Table to track user progress through multi-step registration process
            -- User profile table - Store user details (name, email, password hash, preferences)
        -- API? Integrate breed's group (ID and name... fact(s)) from DogAPI.org, based on user input breed name
        -- AI? Record input data by dog*, then experts rate each question by inputs, etc. (*User/Profile/Owner may have more than one dog)
        -- ML? Use machine learning to analyze user data (eventually to start providing (then improving) recommendations
