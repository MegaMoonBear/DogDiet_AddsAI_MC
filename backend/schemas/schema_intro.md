A **schema** is a blueprint or structure that defines:
- Data format - What fields/properties exist
- Data types - What kind of data (string, number, etc.)
- Validation rules - What values are allowed
- Relationships - How data connects

In Programming:
- Database Schema: (a) Structure of database tables (columns, types, constraints) (b) Your **TABLE_CREATE.sql** file IS a database schema
- API Schema (Pydantic Models): (a) Structure of data sent to/from your API; (b) You already have these in main.py!
